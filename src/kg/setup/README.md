Our system is intricately positioned atop various diverse data sources described in the [data formats](../../data_formats/) and the [ontologies](../../ontologies/) chapter. In the subsequent chapters, we explicate the development of [specific programs](../../tools/) designed to generate semantic web files, facilitating their subsequent upload to the knowledge graph. The result of the knowledge graph can then be queried via a [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) interface. The current queries available from [GraphDB](https://wiser-flagship.interactions.ics.unisg.ch/login) are enlisted in the following chapter.
