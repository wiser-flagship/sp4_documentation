# XML based

Here you find a list of the formats using XML to describe their data.

- [EcoSpold01](ec1/index.html)  was created by ecoinvent, a worldwide leading database for LCA data. EcoSpold01 provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) with XML schemas that guide developers in creating datasets according to this specification. The ecoinvent database versions 1 and 2 are expressed in this data format, as well as the UVEK database. 
- [EcoSpold02](ec2/index.html) is the successor of EcoSpold01, used mostly on version 3 of the ecoinvent database; similar to EcoSpold01, it provides an SDK consisting of a set of XML schemas. 
- [ILCD](ilcd/index.html) the International Reference Life Cycle Data System, is an initiative developed by the European Commission aiming at providing guidance and standards for greater consistency and quality as-surance in applying LCA. Like EcoSpold01, the ILCD data format provides an SDK to publish LCA structured data. Plastics Europe is an example of a database expressed in this format.
