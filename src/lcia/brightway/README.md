# Brightway

Brightway is an open-source software package for life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental impact assessment written in the Python programming language. LCA is a method for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product, process, or service. It involves analyzing all of the inputs and outputs of a system, including raw materials, energy use, and waste products, and quantifying the environmental impacts of these inputs and outputs over the entire lifecycle of the system.

Brightway is designed to make it easy to work with large datasets and perform LCA calculations quickly and accurately. It thus provides a powerful tool for anyone interested in performing LCA or evaluating the environmental impacts of products and processes. Brightway is not intended to replace software like SimaPro or OpenLCA, but instead offers possibilities to break the limits of conventional LCA. Brightway is especially attractive for researchers, especially when used with Jupyter notebooks.

Brightway is a SP1 in the WISER project and therefore an essential tool to use. Brightway is well documented [here](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/). Since the UVEK database
