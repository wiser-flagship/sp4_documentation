# OpenLCA

openLCA is an open source and free software for Sustainability and Life Cycle Assessment, with the following features:

- Fast and reliable calculation of your Sustainability Assessment and/or Life Cycle Assessment
- Very detailed insights into calculation and analysis results; identify main drivers throughout the life cycle, by process, flow or impact category, visualize results and locate them on a map
- Best in class import and export capabilities; easy to share your models
- Life Cycle Costing and social assessment smoothly integrated in the life cycle model
- User-friendly; user interface in a variety of languages; advanced and efficient repository and collaboration feature (currently developed)
- Continuous improvement and implementation of new features

It plays in the same league as commercial LCA software, such as SimaPro, GaBi, or Umberto, but offers distinct differences.

OpenLCA is used to transform the PlasticsEurope database LCI data into LCIA results. This was done with the following [application](https://github.com/wiser-flagship/sp4_openLCA_LCIA_Tool/tree/main).
