# LCIA

LCIA stands for Life Cycle Impact Assessment, a crucial component of life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or process throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to production, use, and disposal. LCIA specifically focuses on quantifying and assessing the potential environmental effects associated with various stages of the life cycle. This analysis considers factors such as resource depletion, air and water pollution, climate change, and other ecological indicators. LCIA aids in providing a holistic perspective on the environmental sustainability of products and processes, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable development and resource management.

Several tools exists to calculate the LCIA-Emissions, two of them are relevant for the project:
