# Classification Designer


The Classification Designer is meant to give environmental expert a tool at hand to design new Frameworks, Operational Boundary and Categories to match to the data('s classifications).
It is a Work-in-Progress and several PoC have been tried. You can find them here:

- [Spring Boot and HTMX](https://github.com/wiser-flagship/wiser-sp4-ee-tool.git)
- [Spring Boot and Hilla](https://github.com/wiser-flagship/sp4-ee-tool)


None of the tools have reached a maturity level that is satisfiable to the requirements yet.
