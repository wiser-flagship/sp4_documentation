# Classification Script

The EcoInvent WISER API offered us a possibility to get a current matching between ISIC classification and "older" EcoSpold01 classifications.
We wrote a script which extracts those classification mappings. The script can be found [here](https://github.com/wiser-flagship/sp4-classification-script.git)
