# Github Based GraphDB Uploader

In order to have a single-source-of-truth in the data a [github repository](https://github.com/wiser-flagship/sp4_data_store) was created.

For using this repository in [GraphDB](https://wiser-flagship.interactions.ics.unisg.ch) a tool was written to upload the data from the repository to the GraphDB.

It is designed as a web application in order to allow integrated processing in the future, if needed.

The tool can be found [here](https://github.com/wiser-flagship/sp4_gh_uploader.git)
