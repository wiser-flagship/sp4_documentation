| BActivity          | Defines the identifying information of an activity or process dataset.                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BActivityFlow      | A BActivity is connected with several output and input flows to other BActivities, this notion is defined as BActivityFlow |
| BActivityName      | Defines a specific activityâ€™s name                                                                                         |
| BClassification    | Defines classification pairs to specify the activity.                                                                      |
| BExchange          | Defines the identifying data for intermediate and exchanges or exchanges with the environment.                             |
| BExchangeProperty  | Defines the exact properties of the BExchange.                                                                             |
| BGeography         | Defines information about the geographic validity of the process or activity.                                              |
| BGHGEmissionFactor | Defines the GreenHouseGas emission factor of the BActivity                                                                 |
| BLCIAResult        | Defines a Lifecycle Inventory Assessment result of an Activity                                                             |
| BReferenceFunction | Defines a BActivityFlow that is used a reference and therefore describing the BActivity in more detail                     |
| BTime              | Describes start and end date of the time period for which the dataset is valid.                                            |
