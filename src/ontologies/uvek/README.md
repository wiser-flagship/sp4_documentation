# UVEK

The Swiss departement for Environement, Trafic, Energy and Communication is regularly providing LCI data.
The current LCI data-base has the name: Ã–kobilanzdatenbestand DQRv2:2022. This data-base is provided in EcoSpold01 format.

With the reflective approach we transformed this data set into RDF as well.
